# sheet_to_scheduler
This script turns a spreadsheet into a scheduling software for 1-1s.


# Usage:
1. Using the spreadsheet tabs at the bottom of the page, go to the other person's sheet and write your name for the time you want on their sheet, or write their name in your sheet.
Make sure that you write your name exactly as it is written on your sheet! The dropdowns should help.
2. Send them a DM on Slack to make sure they see the meeting and that it works for them."						
						
						
						
						
						
"The sheets below are an example.
1. If Alice wants to chat with Christine during dinner on Friday, she writes her name in Christine's 1-1 slot for Friday 6:30 to 7:00.
2. Then, she sends Christine a Slack message to confirm that Christine accepts the meeting."						
						
						
						
"Other info:
- Block off with BUSY any times when you're unable to meet with people (Alice doesn't want to meet after 7:30 on Friday). Because of the dark background that just looks like a void.
- Not case sensitive, so capitals don't matter
- DO NOT USE MULTI-CELL FILL! THE AUTOMATED SCRIPT CAN'T HANDLE IT! COPY PASTE THE NAME INTO EACH CELL IF YOU WANT TO SCHEDULE AN EXTRA-LONG MEETING "
